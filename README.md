# AppCore: Tiny, Basic PHP Framwork

AppCore is what the title says. A tiny basic PHP framwork. I rolled this for use in various super-simple custom PHP projects I've created that just don't need a full-blown framework.

This is essentially a single file (Core.php) with some useful components included.

Although I hope to one day (maybe...) expand this README, here's a summary of AppCore:

* Singleton factory for reusing objects
* Basic routing for converting URLs to files
    * @TODO here for supporting non-file routes
* XML based app configuration
* Basic template loader features
* Miscellaneous helpers

Nothing fancy but helps get super simple apps off the ground.

Includes a basic MySQL component and CURL component.

Use however you would like. Modify however you would like. Attribute however you would like. Ownership remains mine, however.
